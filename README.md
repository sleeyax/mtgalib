Library for Magic: The Gathering Arena that facilitates the creation of headless game clients, mods and applications. 

This repo used to be private, but I decided to make it public because I've put in quite some good amount of work and think the result of that should be publicly available :)

I do not plan to maintain this source code any longer since I've stopped playing the game.
I'm not sure if it even still works, but feel free to fork it and continue building on top of it!
